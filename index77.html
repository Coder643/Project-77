    <h4>What is Console?</h4>
    <p>The browser console, as the name suggests, is a console in the browser. Just as you can run Python or Node.js
        code on a console in your terminal, and print results and log errors, the console in your browser allows you to
        run Javascript code and log information pertinent to your website.</p>
    <script>
        var fname = "John";
        console.log(fname);

        var lname = "Paul";
        console.log(lname);

        var fullname = fname.concat(lname);
        console.log(fullname);

        var name="His name is John Paul"

        var replace_name = name.replace("Paul", "Cena");
        console.log(replace_name);
        
        var a = 20;
        var b = 50;
        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add);
